# Prompt Engineering Process

### Step 1
#### Intention
>What is the improvement that you intend to make?
The agent should be capable of conveying emotions effectively in its responses.
#### Action/Change
>Why do you think this action/change will improve the agent?
By including a system message that prompts the agent to "have emotions like a human being and be able to convey those emotions in your responses," the agent is guided to produce more human-like and engaging responses.

The choice of the model (llama3.2) and specific parameters (e.g., temperature: 0.5 and max_tokens: 100) help to balance creativity and coherence, ensuring that the responses are both expressive and relevant.
#### Result
>What was the result?
The agent started to provide more nuanced and expressive responses, making the conversation more engaging and relatable.

The changes in the model parameters allowed the agent to maintain a good balance between creativity and coherence, making the conversations both interesting and sensible.
#### Reflection/Analysis of the result. 
>Why do you think it did or did not work?

The changes were successful in making the agent's responses more human-like and emotionally expressive.
There may have been instances where the agent's responses were overly emotional or slightly off-target.
Iterative improvements and careful experimentation are key to achieving the desired results.
